At the software level, within an operating system , a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service . A port is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by a 16-bit unsigned number , known as the port number. The most common transport protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). reference What is Port? \u00b6 What is Port Forwarding and NAT \u00b6 What is Port Forwarding and NAT \u00b6 https://www.networkantics.com/sonicwall-port-forwarding/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation What is Internet Packet (IP) \u00b6 What is Domain Name Server (DNS)? \u00b6 The Submarine Cable Map \u00b6 https://www.submarinecablemap.com/ Shortcuts \u00b6 \\[ \\text{Before starting to do anything, if there are shortcuts, try to learn them.} \\] Microsoft Helper Toolkits \u00b6 Install Power Toys Utility https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/ Download Sysinternals Suite (Toolkit) https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite Windows Shortcuts \u00b6 Copy : Ctrl+C Cut : Ctrl+X Paste : Ctrl+V Windows Shortcuts \u00b6 Snipping Tool : Win+Shift+S Depending on your hardware take a screenshot Win+PrtScn Fn+Win+Space .

It's much like Windows Explorer or Finder on the Mac, but without the graphical interface. Other names for the command line are: cmd, CLI, prompt, console or terminal While there are many commands you can use with CLI, they all fall into two categories : The commands that handle the processes The commands that handle the files reference Why Would You Use CLI over GUI? \u00b6 Less Resource It is not a secret that the text-based program needs very little resources of your computer. This means that with CLI you can do similar tasks with minimum resources. Why Would You Use CLI over GUI? \u00b6 High Precision You can use a specific command to target specific destinations with ease. As long as you don\u2019t type the wrong command, it will work like a charm. Once you learn the basics, writing syntax is not as hard as you might think. Why Would You Use CLI over GUI? \u00b6 Repetitive Tasks Friendly GUI has developed well over the years. But, the operating system may not give you all the menus and buttons to perform all tasks. One of the reasons is safety. This leaves you overwhelmed if you have to do repetitive tasks. For example, when you have to handle hundreds of files within a folder, CLI enables you to use a single command to do automate the repetition easily. Why Would You Use CLI over GUI? \u00b6 Powerful Most operating systems today prevent you from messing up the system\u2019s core process. Windows has system protection and MacOS has SIP (System Integrity Protection). You won\u2019t be able to perform certain tasks which are system protected. However, with CLI, you will have full control over your system. Open the command-line interface (Windows) \u00b6 Go to the Start menu or screen, and enter Command Prompt in the search field.

Command Basics (Delete File) in Windows \u00b6 >DEL /F untitled.txt* - If you want to add the options like force deletion, you can add it before the file name Copy Files in Linux \u00b6 Use the cp command to copy files from the current directory to a different directory. For instance, the command cp scenery.jpg /home/username/Pictures would create a copy of scenery.jpg (from your current directory) into the Pictures directory. Copy Files in Windows \u00b6 cd- (with a hyphen) to move to your previous directoryCopy a file in the current folder >COPY source_file.doc newfile.doc - Copy from a different folder/directory: >COPY \"C:\\my work\\some file.doc\" \"D:\\New docs\\newfile.doc\" \u00b6 Copy Files in Windows \u00b6 Specify the source only, with a wildcard will copy all the files into the current directory:* >COPY \"C:\\my work\\*.doc\" - Specify the source with a wildcard and the destination as a single file, this is generally only useful with plain text files. >COPY \"C:\\my work\\*.txt\" \"D:\\New docs\\combined.txt\" Copy Files in Windows \u00b6 Quiet copy (no feedback on screen)* COPY source_file.doc newfile.doc >nul - Copy a file, but do not overwrite if the destination file already exists, this technique only works for a single file, no wildcards: Echo n|COPY /-y c:\\demo\\source_file.txt c:\\dir\\dest.txt \u00b6 Renaming File in Windows \u00b6 >REN d:untitled.txt untitled1.txt* - To rename a file within a specific folder, use REN [drive:][path] [source] [target] - If you mention the location, that means the renamed file will be saved in the same folder >REN d:untitled.txt ..\\..\\folder\\untitled1.txt* >REN d:untitled.txt C:\\folder\\untitled1.txt Renaming File in Linux and OS X \u00b6 >mv [OPTIONS] source destination* >mv file1.txt file2.txt* Optional sudo apt install rename Move Files in Windows \u00b6 In the current folder >MOVE oldfile.wp newfile.doc - Full path specified >MOVE g:\\department\\oldfile.wp \"c:\\Files to Convert\\newfile.doc\" - Specify the drive and filename (assumes the current folder on both drives is correct) >MOVE a:oldfile.wp c:newfile.doc \u00b6 Move Files in Windows \u00b6 Specify source only (will copy the file to current folder, keeping the same filename) >MOVE g:\\department\\oldfile.wp - Quiet move (no feedback on screen) >MOVE oldfile.wp newfile.doc >nul - Move a file, but do not overwrite if the destination file already exists, this technique only works for a single file, no wildcards - ( /-y is required): >Echo n|MOVE /-y c:\\file1.txt c:\\dir\\file1.txt Move Files in Linux and OS X \u00b6 Check mv command For example: mv file.txt /home/username/Documents Command Basics (Renaming a Volume Disk) in Windows \u00b6 D:\\ > LABEL d:MyData Measure Processing Time in Windows Powershell \u00b6 > Measure-Command {echo hi} Days : 0 Hours : 0 Minutes : 0 Seconds : 0 Milliseconds : 0 Ticks : 1318 TotalDays : 1.52546296296296E-09 TotalHours : 3.66111111111111E-08 TotalMinutes : 2.19666666666667E-06 TotalSeconds : 0.0001318 TotalMilliseconds : 0.1318 Measure Processing Time in Windows Command Prompt \u00b6 > powershell -Command \"Measure-Command {echo hi}\" \u00b6 Command Basics (Measure Processing Time) \u00b6 timecmd.bat @echo off @setlocal set start=%time% :: Runs your command cmd /c %* set end=%time% set options=\"tokens=1-4 delims=:.,\" for /f %options% %%a in (\"%start%\") do set start_h=%%a&set /a start_m=100%%b %% 100&set /a start_s=100%%c %% 100&set /a start_ms=100%%d %% 100 for /f %options% %%a in (\"%end%\") do set end_h=%%a&set /a end_m=100%%b %% 100&set /a end_s=100%%c %% 100&set /a end_ms=100%%d %% 100 set /a hours=%end_h%-%start_h% set /a mins=%end_m%-%start_m% set /a secs=%end_s%-%start_s% set /a ms=%end_ms%-%start_ms% if %ms% lss 0 set /a secs = %secs% - 1 & set /a ms = 100%ms% if %secs% lss 0 set /a mins = %mins% - 1 & set /a secs = 60%secs% if %mins% lss 0 set /a hours = %hours% - 1 & set /a mins = 60%mins% if %hours% lss 0 set /a hours = 24%hours% if 1%ms% lss 100 set ms=0%ms% :: Mission accomplished set /a totalsecs = %hours%*3600 + %mins%*60 + %secs% echo command took %hours%:%mins%:%secs%.%ms% (%totalsecs%.%ms%s total) \u00b6 Command Basics (Measure Processing Time) \u00b6 Usage If you put timecmd.bat in a directory in your path, you can call it from anywhere like this: >timecmd [your command] - E.g. C:\\>timecmd pause Press any key to continue . . . command took 0:0:1.18 Command Basics (Measure Processing Time) \u00b6 If you want to do output redirection, you can quote the command like this: timecmd \"dir c:\\windows /s > nul\" This should handle commands that run from before- to after-midnight, but the output will be wrong if your command runs for 24 hours or more. Useful Linux Commands \u00b6 Use Online Sandbox to Try Commands Yourself https://ubunlog.com/en/gnulinux-online-terminals-browser/ https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192 cat command \u00b6 cat (short for concatenate) is one of the most frequently used commands in Linux. It is used to list the contents of a file on the standard output (sdout). To run this command, type cat followed by the file\u2019s name and its extension. For instance: cat file.txt . Here are other ways to use the cat command: cat > filename creates a new file cat filename1 filename2>filename3 joins two files (1 and 2) and stores the output of them in a new file (3) to convert a file to upper or lower case use, cat filename | tr a-z A-Z >output.txt touch command \u00b6 The touch command allows you to create a blank new file through the Linux command line. As an example, enter touch /home/username Documents/Web.html to create an HTML file entitled Web under the Documents directory. locate command \u00b6 You can use this command to locate a file, just like the search command in Windows. What\u2019s more, using the -i argument along with this command will make it case-insensitive, so you can search for a file even if you don\u2019t remember its exact name. To search for a file that contains two or more words, use an asterisk ( * ). For example, locate -i school*note* command will search for any file that contains the word \u201c school \u201d and \u201c note \u201d, whether it is uppercase or lowercase. find command \u00b6 Similar to the locate command, using find also searches for files and directories. The difference is, you use the find command to locate files within a given directory. As an example, find /home/ -name notes.txt command will search for a file called notes.txt within the home directory and its subdirectories. Other variations when using the find are: To find files in the current directory use, find -name notes.txt To look for directories use, / -type d -name notes. txt grep command \u00b6 Another basic Linux command that is undoubtedly helpful for everyday use is grep . It lets you search through all the text in a given file. To illustrate, grep blue notepad.txt will search for the word blue in the notepad file. Lines that contain the searched word will be displayed fully. sudo command \u00b6 Short for \" SuperUser Do \", this command enables you to perform tasks that require administrative or root permissions. However, it is not advisable to use this command for daily use because it might be easy for an error to occur if you did something wrong. df command \u00b6 Use df command to get a report on the system\u2019s disk space usage, shown in percentage and KBs. If you want to see the report in megabytes, type df -m . du command \u00b6 If you want to check how much space a file or a directory takes, the du (Disk Usage) command is the answer. However, the disk usage summary will show disk block numbers instead of the usual size format. If you want to see it in bytes, kilobytes, and megabytes, add the -h argument to the command line. head command \u00b6 \u2022 The head command is used to view the first lines of any text file. By default, it will show the first ten lines, but you can change this number to your liking. For example, if you only want to show the first five lines, type head -n 5 filename.ext . tail command \u00b6 This one has a similar function to the head command, but instead of showing the first lines, the tail command will display the last ten lines of a text file. For example, tail -n filename.ext. diff command \u00b6 Short for difference, the diff command compares the contents of two files line by line. After analyzing the files, it will output the lines that do not match. Programmers often use this command when they need to make program alterations instead of rewriting the entire source code. The simplest form of this command is diff file1.ext file2.ext tar command \u00b6 The tar command is the most used command to archive multiple files into a tarball \u2014 a common Linux file format that is similar to zip format, with compression being optional. https://www.linuxtechi.com/17-tar-command-examples-in-linux/ chmod command \u00b6 chmod is another Linux command, used to change the read, write, and execute permissions of files and directories. https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uchmod.htm chown command \u00b6 In Linux, all files are owned by a specific user. The chown command enables you to change or transfer the ownership of a file to the specified username. For instance, chown linuxuser2 file.ext will make linuxuser2 as the owner of the file.ext . jobs command \u00b6 jobs command will display all current jobs along with their statuses. A job is basically a process that is started by the shell. The jobs command displays the status of jobs started in the current terminal window. Jobs are numbered starting from 1 for each session. The job ID numbers are used by some programs instead of PIDs (for example, by fg and bg commands). kill command \u00b6 If you have an unresponsive program, you can terminate it manually by using the kill command. It will send a certain signal to the misbehaving app and instructs the app to terminate itself. There is a total of sixty-four-signals that you can use, but people usually only use two signals: kill command \u00b6 SIGTERM (15) : requests a program to stop running and gives it some time to save all of its progress. If you don\u2019t specify the signal when entering the kill command, this signal will be used. kill command \u00b6 SIGKILL (9) : forces programs to stop immediately. Unsaved progress will be lost. Besides knowing the signals, you also need to know the process identification number (PID) of the program you want to kill . If you don\u2019t know the PID, simply run the command ps ux . After knowing what signal you want to use and the PID of the program, enter the following syntax: kill [signal option] PID . https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/linux-signals-part-1/ ping command \u00b6 Use the ping command to check your connectivity status to a server. For example, by simply entering ping google.com , the command will check whether you\u2019re able to connect to Google and also measure the response time. wget command \u00b6 The Linux command line is super useful \u2014 you can even download files from the internet with the help of the wget command. To do so, simply type wget followed by the download link. uname command \u00b6 The uname command, short for Unix Name, will print detailed information about your Linux system like the machine name, operating system, kernel, and so on. top command \u00b6 As a terminal equivalent to Task Manager in Windows, the top command will display a list of running processes and how much CPU each process uses. It\u2019s very useful to monitor system resource usage, especially knowing which process needs to be terminated because it consumes too many resources. history command \u00b6 When you\u2019ve been using Linux for a certain period of time, you\u2019ll quickly notice that you can run hundreds of commands every day. As such, running history command is particularly useful if you want to review the commands you\u2019ve entered before. echo command \u00b6 This command is used to move some data into a file. For example, if you want to add the text, \u201c Hello, my name is John \u201d into a file called name.txt , you would type echo Hello, my name is John >> name.txt zip, unzip command \u00b6 Use the zip command to compress your files into a zip archive, and use the unzip command to extract the zipped files from a zip archive. hostname command \u00b6 If you want to know the name of your host/network simply type hostname . Adding a -I to the end will display the IP address of your network. Hostnamectl https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/find-my-linux-machine-name/ host command \u00b6 host command is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments or options are given, host command displays a short summary of its command line arguments and options. The syntax is as follows: host example.com host -t TYPE example.com host -t a example.com https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-dns-lookup-command/ host command \u00b6 Installation of host command if not found root@user:~# apt-get update root@user:~# apt-get install dnsutils \u2013y https://www.crybit.com/install-dig-nslookup-host-commands/ useradd, userdel command \u00b6 Since Linux is a multi-user system, this means more than one person can interact with the same system at the same time. useradd is used to create a new user, while passwd is adding a password to that user\u2019s account. To add a new person named John type, useradd John and then to add his password type, passwd 123456789 . To remove a user is very similar to adding a new user. To delete the users account type, userdel UserName Tips and Tricks for Linux CLI \u00b6 Try the TAB button to autofill what you are typing For example, if you need to type Documents, begin to type a command (let\u2019s go with cd Docu then hit the TAB key) and the terminal will fill in the rest, showing you cd Documents Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Z are used to stop any command that is currently working. Ctrl+C will stop and terminate the command, while Ctrl+Z will simply pause the command. Tips and Tricks for Linux CLI \u00b6 If you accidental freeze your terminal by using Ctrl+S , simply undo this with the unfreeze Ctrl+Q . Ctrl+A moves you to the beginning of the line while Ctrl+E moves you to the end You can run multiple commands in one single command by using the ; to separate them. For example Command1; Command2; Command3 Or use && if you only want the next command to run when the first one is successful. Useful Windows Commands \u00b6 ASSOC: Fix File Associations \u00b6 One of the most powerful tools in the CMD command library is the ASSOC command. Your computer associates certain file extensions with certain programs. This is how your computer knows to open Adobe when you double click a PDF file, or Microsoft Word when you double click a DOC file. You can view all the file associations your computer knows about by typing ASSOC in the command window. You\u2019ll see the file extension and the program it\u2019s associated with. You can set the association by typing something like assoc .doc=Word.Document.8 . FC: File Compare \u00b6 Sometimes when files are changed over time, it\u2019s hard to remember what the differences were between versions. You may not know that a CMD command offers the ability to compare files and see all differences, but it\u2019s true. The FC command performs either an ascii or a binary file comparison and will list all of the differences that it finds. Fc /a File1.txt File2.txt will compare two ascii files. Fc /b Picture1.jpg Picture2.jpg will do a binary compare on two images. IPCONFIG \u00b6 Network troubleshooting is never simple, but one command that makes it much easier is IPCONFIG . Using this command in the CMD command prompt returns detailed information about your current network adapter connection including: Current IP Address Subnet Mask Default Gateway IP Current domain This information can help you troubleshoot router issues and other connection issues you could be having with your network adapter. IPCONFIG \u00b6 Examples: > ipconfig ... Show information > ipconfig /all ... Show detailed information > ipconfig /renew ... renew all adapters > ipconfig /renew EL* ... renew any connection that has its name starting with EL > ipconfig /release *Con* ... release all matching connections, eg. IPCONFIG \u00b6 \"Wired Ethernet Connection 1\" or \"Wired Ethernet Connection 2\" > ipconfig /all compartments ... Show information about all compartments > ipconfig /all compartments /all ... Show detailed information about all compartments /? Display this help message /all Display full configuration information. /release Release the IPv4 address for the specified adapter. /release6 Release the IPv6 address for the specified adapter. IPCONFIG \u00b6 /renew Renew the IPv4 address for the specified adapter. /renew6 Renew the IPv6 address for the specified adapter. /flushdns Purges the DNS Resolver cache. /registerdns Refreshes all DHCP leases and re-registers DNS names /displaydns Display the contents of the DNS Resolver Cache. /showclassid Displays all the dhcp class IDs allowed for adapter. /setclassid Modifies the dhcp class id. /showclassid6 Displays all the IPv6 DHCP class IDs allowed for adapter. /setclassid6 Modifies the IPv6 DHCP class id. NETSTAT: Network Statistics \u00b6 Concerned that you could have malware running on your computer that\u2019s connecting to internet locations without you knowing about it? If you run a NETSTAT command in the command prompt, you can get a list of all active TCP connections from your computer. PING: Send Test Packets \u00b6 An IT Analyst\u2019s best friend is the PING command. Running this command sends test packets over the network to the target system. You can use the PING command to test whether your computer can access another computer, a server, or even a website. It can help with revealing network disconnections. It also provides transit time for the packets in milliseconds, so it also reveals a bad network connection as well. PING: Send Test Packets \u00b6 https://ipstack.com/ ipstack offers one of the leading TRACERT: Trace Route IP to geolocation \u00b6 APIs and global IP database services worldwide. POWERCFG: Power Configuration \u00b6 Are you frustrated with how quickly your laptop seems to run out of power? It could be that your power settings are configured as efficiently as possible. There\u2019s a windows CMD command called POWERCFG (power configuration) that can help. POWERCFG: Power Configuration \u00b6 Run the command prompt as an administrator and type powercfg \u2013 energy to get a full power efficiency report. The process can take up to about a minute, but when it\u2019s done, you\u2019ll see whether there are any warnings or errors that might help you improve the power efficiency of your system. SHUTDOWN: Turn Off Computer \u00b6 The SHUTDOWN command is a pretty versatile command that lets you shutdown the computer but control the behavior of that shutdown. It\u2019s commonly used as a scheduled task or part of an IT batch job after patches have been applied to a computer system. Typing shutdown /i from the command prompt will initiate a shutdown, but it\u2019ll upon a GUI to give the user an option on whether to restart or do a full shutdown. If you don\u2019t want to have any GUI pop up, you can just issue a shutdown /s command. There is a long list of other parameters you can use to do a log off, hibernate, restart, and more. Just type shutdown without any arguments to see them all. SYSTEMINFO: System Information \u00b6 If you need to know what brand of network card you have, processor details, or the exact version of your Windows OS, the SYSTEMINFO command can help. This command polls your system and pulls the most important information about your system. It lists the information in a clean format that\u2019s easy to read. SFC: System File Checker \u00b6 If you\u2019re ever concerned that a virus or some other software might have corrupted your core system files, there\u2019s a Windows command that can scan those files and ensure their integrity. You need to launch CMD as administrator (right click and choose Run as Administrator ). Typing SFC /SCANNOW will check the integrity of all protected system files. If a problem is found, the files will be repaired with backed-up system files. SFC: System File Checker \u00b6 The SFC command also lets you: /VERIFYONLY : Check the integrity but don\u2019t repair the files. /SCANFILE : Scan the integrity of specific files and fix if corrupted. /VERIFYFILE : Verify the integrity of specific files but don\u2019t repair them. /OFFBOOTDIR : Use this to do repairs on an offline boot directory. /OFFWINDIR : Use this to do repairs on an offline Windows directory. /OFFLOGFILE : Specify a path to save a log file with scan results. The scan can take up to 10 or 15 minutes, so give it time. NET USE: Map drives \u00b6 If you want to map a new drive, you could always open File Explorer, right click on This PC, and go through the Map Network Drive wizard. However, using the NET USE command, you can do the same thing with one command string. For example, if you have a share folder on a computer on your network called \\\\OTHER-COMPUTER\\SHARE\\ , you can map this as your own Z: drive by typing the command: NET USE Z: \u201c\\\\OTHER-COMPUTER\\SHARE\u201d /persistent:yes The persistent switch tells your computer that you want this drive remapped every time you log back into your computer. CHKDSK: Check Disk \u00b6 While the SFC command only checks the integrity of core system files, you can use the CHKDSK command to scan an entire drive. The command to check the C: drive and repair any problems, launch the command window as an administrator and type CHKDSK /f C: . This command checks for things like: File fragmentation Disk errors Bad sectors The command can fix any disk errors (if possible). When the command is finished, you\u2019ll see a status of the scan and what actions were taken. SCHTASKS: Schedule Tasks \u00b6 Windows comes with a wizard for creating scheduled tasks. For example, maybe you have a BAT file stored on C:\\temp that you want to run every day at noon. You\u2019d have to click through the Scheduled Task wizard to configure this. Or you can type a single SCHTASKS command to set it up. SCHTASKS /Create /SC HOURLY /MO 12 /TR Example /TN c:\\temp\\File1.bat The scheduled switch accepts arguments like minute, hourly, daily, and monthly. Then you specify the frequency with the /MO command. If you typed the command correctly, you\u2019ll see the response, SUCCESS: The scheduled task \u201cExample\u201d has successfully been created . ATTRIB: Change File Attributes \u00b6 In Windows, you can change file attributes by right clicking on a file and finding the right property to change. However, instead of hunting around for the file attribute, you can use the ATTRIB command to set the file attributes. For example, if you type: ATTRIB +R +H C:\\temp\\File1.bat , it\u2019ll set File1.bat as a hidden, read-only file. There is no response when it\u2019s successful, so unless you see an error message, the command worked. Other Windows CMD Commands \u00b6 BITSADMIN : Initiate upload or download jobs over the network or internet and monitor the current state of those file transfers. COLOR : Change the background color of the command prompt window. COMP : Compare the contents of any two files to see the differences. FIND/FINDSTR : Search for strings inside of any ASCII files. PROMPT : Change the command prompt from C:> to something else. TITLE : Change the title of the command prompt window. REGEDIT : Edit keys in the Windows registry (use with caution). ROBOCOPY : A powerful file copy utility built right into Windows.

JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs) JRE (to execute your java program). JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to only run(not develop) the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs that are end-users of your system. JVM ( Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an **i*****nterpreter*** .

To use theis command replace the values as per your environment. scp username@example.com:/backup/file.zip /local/dir If the SSH is running on a non-standard port, You can specify the port using -P option with SCP command. scp -P 2222 username@example.com:/backup/file.zip /local/dir If your remote server required a private key to connect server, You can use -i followed by a private key file path to connect your server using the SCP command. This can be helpful for AWS servers. scp -i private_key.pem username@example.com:/backup/file.zip /local/dir Upload file using SSH \u00b6 You can also upload files to the remote server using SSH protocol using the SCP command. Use the following example command for uploading files to the SSH server. scp file.zip username@example.com:/remote/dir Similarity you can use -P switch to define port of the SSH server and -i to define private key for the user authentication.
